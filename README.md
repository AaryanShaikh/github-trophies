## Self-modify

You'll have to deploy yourself, for [Vercel](/VercelDeployGuide.md) or [localhost](/LocalDeployGuide.md)

If you want to configure which trophies you automatically get, configure these booleans in [src/card.ts at line 13](/src/trophy.ts#L13)

```ts
let wantAchieveSuperRank = false;
let wantMultipleLang = true;
let wantLongTimeAccount = true;
let wantAncientAccount = false;
let wantNewAccount = false;
let wantMultipleOrganizations = true;
```
